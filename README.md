RPNcalc
=======
This is an assignment from grade 12 computer science.
It invovles linked lists stacks, which work first in, first out.
This means if you want to take the log of 2, you enter 2 and then enter log.
This also means that you can store a lot of numbers in the calculator, but can only work with the top 2.
This restriction makes longer calculations a puzzzle - how do you decide which values to enter first? 
See if you can figure it out.
